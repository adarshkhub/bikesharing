## Summary
Based on these graphs, we can identify several key factors which should aid in creating a robust citibike sharing business in Des Moines. Namely, most customers are subscribers, males use the citibikes more than females, and the citibikes are used longest by approximately 50 year olds (those born in the 1970's), so marketing campaigns targeted towards an older audience will be more successful.
